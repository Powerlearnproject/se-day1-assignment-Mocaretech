Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of engineering where software would be developed using well tested, proved engineering principle, procedure and respective method and tools to produce software product that is useful for its rea mission
importance of software engineer
1. software engineer use a knowledge of program code to solve a real life problem by creating a software
2. They make software product that is simple and easy to use
3. When their is a problem with a software product, the fix the bug efficiency
4. when there is need for upgrading an existing software due to users requirement and expeectation, the software engineer work so hard to make thier wants a reality
5. They involve in collaboration with the tech professonal inorder to build a most viable sotware product

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. foundatational Learning and skill development, they understand software development principle
2. mastering of problem solving, system design and coding practices which can be applied in cybersecurity and cloud computing
3. leadership and impact :The are also involved in taking on a nd mentoring or leadership role(senior developer)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. idea genertation
2. requirement analysis
3. product design
4. product development
5. integration and setting
6. Deployment
7. maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. while waterfall methodology is a well structured, sequential and phase based method the Agile methodology is the iterative and incremental with continuous feedback and improvement
2. waterfall methodology is rigid and less adaptable to changes while thw Agile methodology accomodate flexibility at every stage of development
3. customer invlovement is limited in waterfall methodology while the Agile methodology alllows continuous customer invlovement from continuous feedback
4. Heavy documentation before coding begin is the hallmark of Waterfall methodology while there is lighter documentation in agile method as more concentration is more on the working software

   where are the two methodology appropriate

   agile methodology is more appropriate while we are developing app such as mobile app and e-commerce website and MVP

   Waterfall methodology is more appropriate when developing app such as that for Medical purpose, government agencies and banking system



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer
Role
A software developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing and maintaining software application

Quality Assurance
A quality assurance engineer ensures that a software meets quality standards by identifying bugs, ensuring functionality and improving reliability before release

project manager
A project manager oversees the entire software development proces ensuring the project is completed on time within the budget and meet business goals



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated development environment
This is a software application that provide a complete set of tools for coding, debugging, testing and managing software projects in one place

version control system
This is a tool that tracks the changes to code, allowing developers to collaborate, revert to previous version and maintain project history


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging and fixing bugs
strategies to overcome
  a. use debugging tools
  b. Collaborate with team mate for code review
2. Managing time and deadlines
strategies to overcome
   a. Use Agile methodology
   b. Priotize using time management techniques eg (Eisenhower matrix)

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

software testing ensures that an application function correctly, meet users expectations and is free of critical bugs
Type of testing
1. unit testing : This involve focusing on testing individula componets or unit of program to ensure they work correctly in isolation. This detect bugs early in the developmental cycle
2. intergration test : This ensure that different modules or componenet of an application work together as expected
3. system testing : This evaluate the entireapplication to ensure it meet the functional and performance requirement
4. Accepting testing : This testing is conducted to determine if the application meet user expectations and business goals


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to optimize responses from AI models.
It involves crafting precise, structured, and context-aware queries to achieve the desired output effectively

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of Vague Prompt
Tell me about PLP

Improved prompt
Tell me about the power learning project platform and what course they offer, duration and criteria to get their scholarship scheme

why the improved prompt is more effective
It is more effective because it allow the AI to comprehensively give detailed explanation about a given concept on which enquiry is being made
